# Blink! (Lesson 1)

Blink is intended as a basic tutorial for someone who has never used an Arduino Uno or Spark Core before. 

1. Open up Schematic.png and pull out your Arduino Uno, LED and Resistor. The resistor shouldn't exceed 1k Ohms.
2. Referencing the Schematic above, connect the LED to the breadboard so that the two legs are sitting on two different rows.
3. 
3. Take you resistor and connect one end of it to the same left-to-right rail that the long leg of the LED uses. Connect the resistor to another rail lower on your breadboard.
4. 
4. Take a jumper wire and connect Pin 0 of the Arduino to the opposite leg that we used for the LED.
5. Take another jumper wire and connect a GND pin from the Arduino to the short LED leg.
6. Load up Blink.ino from above and hit upload to flash it to the Arduino.
7. Success! If everything went well, the LED should now be blinking.
